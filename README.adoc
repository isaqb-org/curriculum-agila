== How to check out and build

. Clone the repository - including the submodule:
+
--
[source,shell]
----
Via SSH:
git clone git@github.com:isaqb-org/curriculum-agila.git --recursive

Via HTTPS:
git clone https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-agila.git --recursive
----
--

Prerequisite: You need a Java Runtime(tm) installed.

You build the output documents with gradle.
That will produce both pdf and html output in German (DE) _and_ English (EN), unless you modify the configuration.

In case you want to change that, adjust the following part of `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
task buildDocs {
  group 'Documentation'
  description 'Grouping task for generating all languages in several formats'
  dependsOn "includeLearningObjectives", "renderDE", "renderEN"
}
----

In the task "renderDE", certain attributes (aka variables) are defined that configure the corresponding output.

== Maintainers

It was forked from https://github.com/isaqb-org/advanced-template,
so the contributors of that project basically contributed to this one, too.
